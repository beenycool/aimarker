# CORS Issue Fix for GCSE AI Marker

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues in the GCSE AI Marker application.

## Problem

The frontend hosted on GitHub Pages (https://beenycool.github.io) was unable to communicate with the backend API hosted on Render (https://beenycool-github-io.onrender.com) due to CORS restrictions. This resulted in the following error:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://beenycool-github-io.onrender.com/api/health' from origin 'https://beenycool.github.io' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend CORS Configuration (`backend/src/index.js`)

1. **Hardcoded GitHub Pages Domain**:
   - Added `https://beenycool.github.io` to the default allowed origins list
   - Added a fallback to ensure the GitHub Pages domain is always included

2. **Enhanced CORS Middleware**:
   - Updated the CORS configuration to handle preflight requests correctly
   - Added explicit OPTIONS request handling
   - Added a secondary middleware to ensure CORS headers are set on all responses

3. **Added CORS Test Endpoint**:
   - Created a new `/api/cors-test` endpoint that returns CORS configuration details
   - This helps diagnose CORS issues by showing the actual headers being set

### 2. Frontend Improvements (`app/aimarker.jsx`)

1. **Added CORS Tester Component**:
   - Created a new component to test CORS connectivity directly
   - The component is shown during development or when network errors occur
   - Provides buttons to test both the CORS-test endpoint and the Health endpoint

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improved the frontend error handling for network/CORS issues
   - Added better error messages to help identify when CORS is the problem

### 3. Documentation Updates

1. **Added CORS Troubleshooting to `DEBUG.md`**:
   - Added a dedicated section on diagnosing and fixing CORS issues
   - Provided step-by-step instructions for testing and fixing CORS problems

2. **Updated Deployment Instructions**:
   - Added CORS-specific steps in the deployment guide
   - Emphasized the importance of proper CORS configuration

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the backend with the updated code**:
   - Push the changes to your repository
   - Deploy the updated backend to Render

2. **Test the CORS configuration**:
   - Visit `https://beenycool-github-io.onrender.com/api/cors-test` in your browser
   - Check that the response includes `https://beenycool.github.io` in the allowed origins

3. **Test the frontend**:
   - The frontend should now be able to communicate with the backend
   - The CORS tester component provides additional diagnostic tools

## Potential Ongoing Issues

Even with these fixes, you may encounter CORS issues in certain scenarios:

1. **After Backend Restarts**:
   - Render's free tier services go to sleep after periods of inactivity
   - The first request after waking up may still have CORS issues
   - Solution: Retry the request or manually restart the service

2. **Environment Variable Configuration**:
   - If the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable is not set correctly
   - Solution: Double-check the environment variable configuration in Render

3. **Other Third-Party Requests**:
   - If your application makes requests to other third-party APIs
   - Solution: Check that those APIs also allow requests from your GitHub Pages domain

## Conclusion

The CORS issues have been fixed by ensuring the backend properly includes the GitHub Pages domain in its allowed origins list and correctly sets the CORS headers on all responses. The addition of the CORS tester component and diagnostic endpoints makes it easier to identify and troubleshoot future CORS issues.
