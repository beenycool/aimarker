  - More authentic match flow (slow start, intense finish)
  - Minute-based event probability
  - Added time simulation
- **Enhanced Event Types**:
  - Goals with assists tracking
  - Corners, free kicks, fouls
  - Cards (yellow/red) with consequences
  - Injuries and player impact
  - Goalkeeping saves
  - Offside calls
- **Improved Player Selection**:
  - Position-based event assignment
  - Player rating weighted selection
  - Realistic assist combinations
- **Team vs Team Simulation**:
  - Dual team simulation engine
  - Balanced team strength calculation
  - Separate statistics for both teams
  - Weather and pitch condition effects

**Simulation Improvements:**
- **Event Importance**: High/Medium/Low priority events
- **Player Performance**: Dynamic rating adjustments based on events
- **Match Flow**: Realistic 90-minute progression
- **Environmental Effects**: Weather and pitch conditions affect gameplay
