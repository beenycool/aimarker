# Backend Setup Instructions

To fix the "Failed to get feedback: Failed to fetch" error, you need to:

1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following contents:
```
PORT=3001
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://beenycool.github.io
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

2. Get an API key from OpenRouter (https://openrouter.ai/) and replace `your_openrouter_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

3. Make sure both the frontend and backend servers are running:
   - Frontend: `npm run dev` (in the root directory)
   - Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`

This will allow the frontend to make API calls to the backend, which in turn will use the OpenRouter API to generate feedback for GCSE answers.
