#### Advanced Simulation Engine (`simulation-engine.ts`)
```typescript
// Key Features:
- Position-weighted player selection
- Environmental effect calculations
- Real-time event streaming
- Comprehensive statistics generation
- Async/await simulation with progress callbacks
```

#### Smart Event Generation

- **Pitch condition effects** on overall performance
- **Difficulty scaling** for AI opponent strength

### 🎲 Simulation Logic Examples

#### Goal Event Generation
1. Calculate team strength vs opponent
2. Apply weather/pitch/difficulty modifiers  
3. Select attacking player based on position weights
4. 70% chance to generate assist from midfielder
5. Update scores and create event descriptions

#### Player Rating Calculation
- **Base rating**: 6.0 for all players
- **Goals**: +1.0 per goal scored
- **Assists**: +0.5 per assist
- **Saves**: +0.3 per goalkeeper save
- **Cards**: -0.5 per yellow card
- **Performance variance**: ±1.0 random modifier
- **Attribute bonus**: Based on overall player rating

### 🎮 User Experience Flow
